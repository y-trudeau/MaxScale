### Premium repositories
Once you get premium, the plan you selected delegates the number of premium repositories you're
allowed to have. Premium repositories have many features not available without a premium plan.

### Personally hosted repositories
The premium repositories you select are allowed to be hosted on their own domains, you can choose
a domain in your `support/gitdoc.json` file. Just add a `domain` field with your domain, and
point your domain at our site, and it will automatically load your repo.

### Private repositories
Private repositories cannot be viewed without being set as a premium repository.

### Custom CSS
You're premium repos can have custom layouts through CSS. Once you add a premium repo, simply create
the file `support/styles.css` and refresh your repo, when the page refreshes you'll be able to
see the custom CSS in action.

### Branches
On premium repositories, you can select the branch you want to pull updates from, this is useful
if you plan to display the documentation for a specific version of your software.

### Standard Git repos
Standard Git repositories from non Github servers are supported after you have a premium plan.
To add a standard repo to your account, add support for the repository(You can get the setup
details from your profile page.), after that go to your profile page and at the bottom will be
a form where you can fill out the information to add your repository. After that it can be updated
just like any other repository.
